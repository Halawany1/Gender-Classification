# Gender-Classification
- I made a CNN project for binary classification of (men & women) using kaggle dataset with 27K image ( 17K for men and 9K for women ) , 
but the actual used data is (7k images) separated to (5K for training) , (3K for testing) and (1K for prediction).


# - gathering	dataset:
- I looked for dataset in kaggel which is not  very large and not very	small i found "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maciejgronczynski/biggest- genderface-recognition-dataset" which is 27k image with size 430mg (17K for men & 9K for women) with good	quality images which is pretty impressive , so we downloaded it.
After downloading	we start  to explore it to know which preprocessing is going to be done, we found that there are very small and very large images which have to be resized , we also found some wrong collected images like  being a man and find yourself surrounding by women And vice versa ,we tried to minimize this it and put every image in its right group.
Next step was uploading the dataset  to drive so we can use it freely	, we mange to upload 10K image for men and 9K for women (honestly idk why men images are always bigger than women :) No offense).
now time for code:).
